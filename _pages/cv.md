## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
- Postdoctoral fellow with Dr. Marc W. Kirschner – Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA
  * Develop novel technologies (an image-based single-cell sorter for single-cell transcriptomics and an electrophoresis-based rapid multiplexed immunostaining platform) for the characterization of senescent cells in vivo
  * Develop new automated phenotyping platform and analysis pipeline using video tracking and machine learning to discover anti-aging drugs with Daphnia magna (called “water flea”) 
  * Study the mechanisms of aging processes from phenotype to genotype with Daphnia magna using Systems Biology approach (single-cell RNA-seq, proteomics, behavior phenotyping, and deep learning)
